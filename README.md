## Getting Started

First use   ``` npm install``` to set up the npm 

Then install the dependencies by using the following commands : 
```
npm i bcryptjs next-auth @emailjs/browser mongoose
npm i --save-dev @types/bcryptjs
```
Now run ```npm run dev``` to start the website

Whenever a user logs in or signs up, an email will be sent using EmailJS. It might take some time so be patient
